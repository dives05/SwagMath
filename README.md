<h1>Swagmath.com</h1>    
<h2> Purpose: </h2>
<p> Swagmath.com is an unblocked games website. My goal in creating this website was to provide educational and entertainment resources to students who may have certain URL's blocked on either their device or wifi. </p>

<h2>Notes to developers</h2>
<ul>
<li>The main languge of this website is HTML with heavy use of CSS and a decent amount of javascript used to manage the search bar and category buttons.</li>
<li>Feel free to fork and create changes as you please</li>
<li>I plan to add many more games as this website progresses, feel free to message me with suggestions</li> 
</ul>
